The circular economy, with its focus on reusing and recycling resources to minimize waste, emerges as a crucial strategy in this battle. Innovations like car-sharing platforms significantly reduce the carbon footprint of transportation, while modular designs in various products promote waste reduction by allowing individual components to be upgraded rather than discarding the entire item.\n",

The challenge we confront today, however, extends beyond coming up with solutions to confront this problem.

This process can be overwhelming, given the complexity and the sheer volume of potential solutions, leading to cognitive overload for human evaluators.\n",
