# AIEarthhack2024

# TODO:
- Create Frontend
  - Will discuss basic idea
  - React vs Angular
  - Communicating with backend
- Sort via text-based search on front-end
- Complete Submission Info
- Generate solutions given a problem
  - Uses GPT or another NLP model trained on the dataset
  - Inputs: problems
  - Solutions: answers
  - Possible Applications:
    - Using AI to generate solutions to the problem the user is looking at / has clicked on
    - Using AI to generate solutions to a problem the user enters themselves
- Generate a relevant problem/solution pairs given a user's keyword
  - Arjun is very confident in his ability to make this happen
  - I believe in him
  - Good luck
